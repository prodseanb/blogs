# The Global Impacts of Artificial Intelligence
[A short essay](https://github.com/prodseanb/prodseanb.github.io/blob/master/docs/The%20Evolution%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) documenting my compiled research on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This is a very basic and short introduction to AI and Machine Learning that answers some of the most common controversial questions related to the transition from workplace traditions, sustainability, etc.
