# Objective
This repository contains all my research documents and project reports on a broad range of topics and fields such as Python, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Computer Systems and Networking, Linux, InfoSec, Cybersecurity, DevOps, and more.<br /><br />
The objective of this compilation of research and labs is to expand and diversify both my knowledge and expertise on the fields I mentioned. I am an avid learner and researcher who embraces the challenge of learning something new everyday.
# Kali Linux + Metasploitable Pentesting Project
The objective of [this project](https://prodseanb.github.io/docs/Kali%20Linux%20Metasploitable.pdf) is to simulate a penetration testing environment and explore common exploitation tools and procedures.
### Resources
Resources required for this lab:
- VMware Workstation 16 Pro (or any virtualization software)
- Kali Linux virtual machine
- Metasploitable 2 virtual machine<br />

### Learning Objectives
- Installation and configuration of Metasploitable and Kali Linux on VMware Workstation
- Find 5 vulnerabilities
- Learn 5 common attacks/exploit techniques

# The Global Impacts of Artificial Intelligence
[A short essay](https://prodseanb.github.io/docs/The%20Global%20Impacts%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) documenting my compiled research on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This is a short and concise introduction to AI and Machine Learning that answers some of the most common and controversial questions related to sustainability, transition from the traditional workplace environment, culture influences, etc.  

# Mr. Robot CTF (Vulnhub)

[This CTF documentation](https://prodseanb.github.io/docs/Hacking%20MrRobot.pdf) serves as a rundown of my first CTF attempt. This vulnerable machine is based on the show [Mr. Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot). In this document, I explored several methods of exploitation and security tools.
